Useful-Scripts
====

I always wondered around the internet, looking for scripts that can help me reduce my time to get things done! So I made my own of that sort.

Primarily this Repository has some cool scripts that are generally very useful when taking shortcuts in our work-life.

Hope this helps anyone and everyone as it helps me in my daily life.

PS: I have referred to various websites to pull together this list. I do not own the credits / rights for everything I have in this repo.

Thanks,
Happy Coding!!!
