 * Disclaimer *
 * 
 * This is a Mac app to get all the downloadable links from a given URL. 
 * This is very specific to appleâ€™s WWDC, so if you intend to use it for some other purpose, 
 * its highly possible, that this app may not function as you expect it to.
 *
 * This is a very simple app with one text field, a button, and a textView to show the links
 *
 * These changes are not managed and maintained regularly, so this might not work some time.
